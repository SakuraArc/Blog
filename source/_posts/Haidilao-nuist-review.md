### Haidilao at NUIST: A Quick Review  

Recently, I tried the **Haidilao hot pot** on NUIST’s campus. As a big fan of Haidilao, I was excited to see how it compares to the regular branches outside. Here’s my honest take.  

#### **Portion Size: Smaller Than Usual**  
The first thing I noticed was that the **portion sizes are noticeably smaller** compared to off-campus Haidilao locations. Whether it’s the meat slices, vegetables, or side dishes, you get less for the same price. If you’re used to the generous servings at regular Haidilao, this might be a slight disappointment.  

#### **Limited Menu Options**  
Another difference is the **reduced variety of dishes**. While the classic hot pot ingredients (like beef, lamb, and tofu) are available, some of the more unique or premium items (such as specialty seafood or certain cuts of meat) are missing. The sauce bar also has fewer choices.  

#### **What’s Still Good?**  
- **Service**: The famous **Haidilao customer service** is still here—friendly staff, quick responses, and free snacks while waiting.  
- **Taste**: The broth flavors (spicy, mushroom, tomato, etc.) are just as good as outside.  
- **Convenience**: Being on campus makes it a great option for students who don’t want to travel far.  

#### **Final Verdict**  
If you’re craving Haidilao and don’t want to leave campus, this is a decent choice. However, if you want the **full Haidilao experience** (bigger portions, more variety), it’s worth going to an off-campus location.  

Would I go again? **Yes, but only for convenience.**
